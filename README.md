# HTML to CL-WHO

`cl-who` is a common library for HTML rendering in Common Lisp. The main issue is that all the example online are written in HTML... This tool lets you convert HTML to Sexp!
This project is 100% lisp and it runs completely in the browser!

## Getting started
Just clone the repository in a directory inside the asdf path and then run `asdf:load-system :html-conv`, it will start a server on port 3333.
